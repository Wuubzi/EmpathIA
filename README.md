“Understanding emotions to save lives.”
EmpathIA detects emotional risk through language to promote early mental health intervention.

🧭 Overview

EmpathIA is an intelligent system that analyzes text in real time to identify emotional distress signals and trigger preventive actions.
It combines NLP, a custom Spring Boot MCP Server, and a GPT-based LLM to classify emotions and generate alerts or empathetic responses.

🧩 Project Structure
Folder	Responsible	Description
/backend	Carlos Salas	Spring Boot MCP Server, API orchestration, data routing
/frontend	Zharick Londoño	React interface, UX flow, and documentation
/llm	Santiago Palomino	GPT model integration, emotional dataset, Supabase pipeline

All components communicate via a custom Model Control Protocol (MCP) that ensures synchronized processing and response consistency.

🎯 General Objective

Design and implement an AI-driven emotional risk detection ecosystem that identifies distress patterns in text and provides early mental health support.

💬 Helping people before the crisis becomes visible.

⚙️ Specific Objectives

🧠 Classify emotions and risk levels (Low, Medium, High) using GPT-based NLP.

🤖 Trigger automated empathy responses or alerts.

🧩 Connect frontend, backend, and LLM via Spring Boot MCP Server.

🔐 Ensure compliance with Law 1581/2012 (Habeas Data – Colombia).

🚀 Maintain modularity and scalability for future extensions.

1. 🖥️ Frontend (React)

Interactive interface for posting, emotional feedback, and support chat.

Integrated visualization of user’s emotional trends and alerts.

Designed for accessibility and empathetic UX.

2. ⚙️ Backend (Spring Boot + MCP)

Core logic and communication hub between LLM and frontend.

Routes content for emotional classification and response generation.

Implements MCP Server for secure and standardized message exchange.

3. 🗄️ Database (Supabase + PostgreSQL)

Stores emotional analyses, alerts, user data, and monitoring logs.

Supports anonymization and compliance with ethical data practices.
